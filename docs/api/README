The files under this directory document the API of mod_perl project
and its sub-projects. Since for mod_perl 2.0 most of the code is
autogenerated it's much easier to keep the documentation in a separate
place.

Each sub-project will have its own directory under docs/src/api

Here is an example:

docs/src/api:
  mod_perl-2.0/APR/Table.pod 
  mod_perl-2.0/Apache/RequestRec.pod 
  mod_perl-2.0/Apache/compat.pod
  Apache-Test/Apache/Test.pod
  Apache-Registry/Apache/Registry.pod

Keeping all the docs under the same directory makes it easy to
distribute only the documentation, especially simplify the build,
since they all live in a separate modperl-docs project.

So modperl-2.0's API goes into docs/src/api/mod_perl-2.0,
Apache-Test's into docs/src/api/Apache-Test and etc.

If later on we want to move directories around, this is very easy to
do without losing cvs history.

That's said, when you send in new patches, from now on please don't
forget to send documentation patches. It's much easier and nicer to
document as we go, then doing this at then end.

If you create a new pod file, try to follow the conventions used in
other pod files under the same tree.
