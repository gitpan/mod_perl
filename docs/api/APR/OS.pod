=head1 NAME

APR::OS - Perl API for Platform-specific APR API




=head1 Synopsis

  use APR::OS ();
  
  # get thread id
  my $tid_obj = APR::OS::thread_current();
  my $tid = $$tid_obj;





=head1 Description

C<APR::OS> provides the Perl interface to platform-specific APR API.

You should be extremely careful when relying on any of the API
provided by this module, since they are no portable. So if you use
those you application will be non-portable as well.




=head1 API

C<APR::OS> provides the following methods:










=head2 C<thread_current>

Get the thread ID

  $tid_obj = APR::OS::thread_current();

=over 4

=item ret: C<$tid_obj> ( C<APR::OS::Thread> object )

To get the thread id dereference it: C<$$tid_obj>.

That value is a thread ID under threaded MPMs, otherwise 0.

=item since: 1.99_12

Example:

    use Apache::MPM ();
    use APR::OS ();
    if (Apache::MPM->is_threaded) {
        my $tid_obj = APR::OS::thread_current();
        print "TID: $$tid_obj";
    }
    else {
        print "PID: $$";
    }
