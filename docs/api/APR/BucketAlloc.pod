=head1 NAME

APR::BucketAlloc - Perl API for apr_bucket_alloc_t




=head1 Synopsis




=head1 Description

At the moment C<APR::BucketAlloc> is a virtual class, which doesn't
exists as a module/package - so you don't need to load it, nor does it
contain any callable methods or functions.

Objects blessed into C<APR::BucketAlloc> class, are returned by
C<L<$c-E<gt>bucket_alloc|docs::2.0::api::Apache::Connection/C_bucket_alloc_>>
and used by
C<L<APR::Brigade-E<gt>new|docs::2.0::api::APR::Brigade/C_new_>>.

At the moment it can be used only inside httpd. In order to be usable
outside httpd we may need to create a real package and provide an
alternative method to buckets allocation. It'll be added as soon as
there will be a need for that functionality.
