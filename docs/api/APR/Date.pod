=head1 Description

META: to be completed




=head1 API

C<APR::Date> provides the following functions and/or methods:




=head2 C<parse_http>

META: Autogenerated - needs to be reviewed/completed

Parses an HTTP date in one of three standard forms:

  Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123
  Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036
  Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994       ; ANSI C's asctime() format

  $ret = parse_http($date);

=over 4

=item arg1: C<$date> (string)

The date in one of the three formats above

=item ret: C<$ret> (number)

the apr_time_t number of microseconds since 1 Jan 1970 GMT, or
0 if this would be out of range or if the date is invalid.

=back





=head2 C<parse_rfc>

META: Autogenerated - needs to be reviewed/completed

Parses a string resembling an RFC 822 date.  This is meant to be
leinent in its parsing of dates.  Hence, this will parse a wider
range of dates than apr_date_parse_http.

The prominent mailer (or poster, if mailer is unknown) that has
been seen in the wild is included for the unknown formats:

  Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123
  Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036
  Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994       ; ANSI C's asctime() format
  Sun, 6 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT   ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123
  Sun, 06 Nov 94 08:49:37 GMT    ; RFC 822

  $ret = parse_rfc($date);

=over 4

=item arg1: C<$date> (string)

The date in one of the formats above

=item ret: C<$ret> (number)

the apr_time_t number of microseconds since 1 Jan 1970 GMT, or
0 if this would be out of range or if the date is invalid.
