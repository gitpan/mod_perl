APR - Perl Interface for libapr and libaprutil Libraries

=head1 Synopsis

  use APR;

=head1 Description

Notes on how to use APR outside mod_perl 2.0.

Normally you don't need to use this module. However if you are using
an C<APR::> package outside of mod_perl, you need to load APR
first. For example:

  % perl -MApache2 -MAPR -MAPR::UUID -le 'print APR::UUID->new->format'
