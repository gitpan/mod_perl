HTTP Handlers

=head1 Description

This chapter explains how to implement the HTTP protocol handlers in
mod_perl.


=head1 HTTP Request Cycle Phases

Those familiar with mod_perl 1.0 will find the HTTP request cycle in
mod_perl 2.0 to be almost identical to the mod_perl 1.0's model. The
only difference is in the I<response> phase which now includes
filtering. Also the C<PerlHandler> directive has been renamed to
C<PerlResponseHandler> to better match the corresponding Apache phase
name (I<response>).

The following diagram depicts the HTTP request life cycle and
highlights which handlers are available to mod_perl 2.0:

=for html

From the diagram it can be seen that an HTTP request is processes by
11 phases, executed in the following order:

=over

=item 1 PerlPostReadRequestHandler (PerlInitHandler)

=item 2 PerlTransHandler

=item 3 PerlHeaderParserHandler (PerlInitHandler)

=item 4 PerlAccessHandler

=item 5 PerlAuthenHandler

=item 6 PerlAuthzHandler

=item 7 PerlTypeHandler

=item 8 PerlFixupHandler

=item 9 PerlResponseHandler

=item 10 PerlLogHandler

=item 11 PerlCleanupHandler

It's possible that the cycle will not be completed if any of the
phases terminates it, usually when an error happens.

Notice that when the response handler is reading the input data it can
be filtered through request input filters, which are preceded by
connection input filters if any. Similarly the generated response is
first run through request output filters and eventually through
connection output filters before it's sent to the client. We will talk
about filters in detail later in this chapter.

Now let's discuss each of the mentioned handlers in detail.

=head2 PerlPostReadRequestHandler

The I<post_read_request> phase is the first request phase and happens
immediately after the request has been read and HTTP headers were
parsed.

This phase is usually used to do processing that must happen once per
request. For example C<Apache::Reload> is usually invoked at this
phase to reload modified Perl modules.

This phase is of type
C<L<RUN_ALL|docs::2.0::user::handlers::intro/item_RUN_ALL>>.

The handler's configuration scope is
C<L<SRV|docs::2.0::user::config::config/item_SRV>>, because at this
phase the request has not yet been associated with a particular
filename or directory.

Now, let's look at an example. Consider the following registry script:

  touch.pl
  --------
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  
  use Apache::ServerUtil ();
  use File::Spec::Functions qw(catfile);
  
  my $r = shift;
  $r->content_type('text/plain');
  
  my $conf_file = catfile Apache::server_root_relative($r->pool, 'conf'),
      "httpd.conf";
  
  printf "$conf_file is %0.2f minutes old", 60*24*(-M $conf_file);

This registry script is supposed to print when the last time
I<httpd.conf> has been modified, compared to the start of the request
process time. If you run this script several times you might be
surprised that it reports the same value all the time. Unless the
request happens to be served by a recently started child process which
will then report a different value. But most of the time the value
won't be reported correctly.

This happens because the C<-M> operator reports the difference between
file's modification time and the value of a special Perl variable
C<$^T>. When we run scripts from the command line, this variable is
always set to the time when the script gets invoked. Under mod_perl
this variable is getting preset once when the child process starts and
doesn't change since then, so all requests see the same time, when
operators like C<-M>, C<-C> and C<-A> are used.

Armed with this knowledge, in order to make our code behave similarly
to the command line programs we need to reset C<$^T> to the request's
start time, before C<-M> is used. We can change the script itself, but
what if we need to do the same change for several other scripts and
handlers? A simple C<PerlPostReadRequestHandler> handler, which will
be executed as the very first thing of each requests, comes handy
here:

  file:MyApache/TimeReset.pm
  --------------------------
  package MyApache::TimeReset;
  
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  
  use Apache::RequestRec ();
  
  use Apache::Const -compile => 'OK';
  
  sub handler {
      my $r = shift;
      $^T = $r->request_time;
      return Apache::OK;
  }
  1;

We could do:

  $^T = time();

But to make things more efficient we use C<$r-E<gt>request_time> since
the request object C<$r> already stores the request's start time, so
we get it without performing an additional system call.

To enable it just add to I<httpd.conf>:

  PerlPostReadRequestHandler MyApache::TimeReset

either to the global section, or to the C<E<lt>VirtualHostE<gt>>
section if you want this handler to be run only for a specific virtual
host.






=head2 PerlTransHandler

The I<translate> phase is used to perform the translation of a
request's URI into an corresponding filename. If no custom handler is
provided, the server's standard translation rules (e.g., C<Alias>
directives, mod_rewrite, etc.) will continue to be used. A
C<PerlTransHandler> handler can alter the default translation
mechanism or completely override it.

In addition to doing the translation, this stage can be used to modify
the URI itself and the request method. This is also a good place to
register new handlers for the following phases based on the URI.

This phase is of type
C<L<RUN_FIRST|docs::2.0::user::handlers::intro/item_RUN_FIRST>>.

The handler's configuration scope is
C<L<SRV|docs::2.0::user::config::config/item_SRV>>, because at this
phase the request has not yet been associated with a particular
filename or directory.

There are many useful things that can be performed at this
stage. Let's look at the example handler that rewrites request URIs,
similar to what mod_rewrite does. For example, if your web-site was
originally made of static pages, and now you have moved to a dynamic
page generation chances are that you don't want to change the old
URIs, because you don't want to break links for those who link to your
site. If the URI:

  http://example.com/news/20021031/09/index.html

is now handled by:

  http://example.com/perl/news.pl?date=20021031&id=09&page=index.html

the following handler can do the rewriting work transparent to
I<news.pl>, so you can still use the former URI mapping:

  file:MyApache/RewriteURI.pm
  ---------------------------
  package MyApache::RewriteURI;
  
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  
  use Apache::RequestRec ();
  
  use Apache::Const -compile => qw(DECLINED);
  
  sub handler {
      my $r = shift;
  
      my ($date, $id, $page) = $r->uri =~ m|^/news/(\d+)/(\d+)/(.*)|;
      $r->uri("/perl/news.pl");
      $r->args("date=$date&id=$id&page=$page");
  
      return Apache::DECLINED;
  }
  1;

The handler matches the URI and assigns a new URI via C<$r-E<gt>uri()>
and the query string via C<$r-E<gt>args()>. It then returns
C<Apache::DECLINED>, so the next translation handler will get invoked,
if more rewrites and translations are needed.

Of course if you need to do a more complicated rewriting, this handler
can be easily adjusted to do so.

To configure this module simply add to I<httpd.conf>:

  PerlTransHandler +MyApache::RewriteURI






=head2 PerlHeaderParserHandler

The I<header_parser> phase is the first phase to happen after the
request has been mapped to its C<E<lt>LocationE<gt>> (or an equivalent
container). At this phase the handler can examine the request headers
and to take a special action based on these. For example this phase
can be used to block evil clients targeting certain resources, while
little resources were wasted so far.

This phase is of type
C<L<RUN_ALL|docs::2.0::user::handlers::intro/item_RUN_ALL>>.

The handler's configuration scope is
C<L<DIR|docs::2.0::user::config::config/item_DIR>>.

This phase is very similar to
C<L<PerlPostReadRequestHandler|/PerlPostReadRequestHandler>>, with the
only difference that it's run after the request has been mapped to the
resource. Both phases are useful for doing something once per request,
as early as possible. And usually you can take any
C<L<PerlPostReadRequestHandler|/PerlPostReadRequestHandler>> and turn
it into C<L<PerlHeaderParserHandler|/PerlHeaderParserHandler>> by
simply changing the directive name in I<httpd.conf> and moving it
inside the container where it should be executed. Moreover, because
of this similarity mod_perl provides a special directive
C<L<PerlInitHandler|/PerlInitHandler>> which if found outside resource
containers behaves as
C<L<PerlPostReadRequestHandler|/PerlPostReadRequestHandler>>,
otherwise as C<L<PerlHeaderParserHandler|/PerlHeaderParserHandler>>.

You already know that Apache handles the C<HEAD>, C<GET>, C<POST> and
several other HTTP methods. But did you know that you can invent your
own HTTP method as long as there is a client that supports it. If you
think of emails, they are very similar to HTTP messages: they have a
set of headers and a body, sometimes a multi-part body. Therefore we
can develop a handler that extends HTTP by adding a support for the
C<EMAIL> method.  We can enable this protocol extension and push the
real content handler during the
C<L<PerlHeaderParserHandler|/PerlHeaderParserHandler>> phase:

  <Location /email>
      PerlHeaderParserHandler MyApache::SendEmail
  </Location>

and here is the C<MyApache::SendEmail> handler:

  file:MyApache/SendEmail.pm
  --------------------------
  package MyApache::SendEmail;
  
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  
  use Apache::RequestRec ();
  use Apache::RequestIO ();
  use Apache::RequestUtil ();
  
  use Apache::Const -compile => qw(DECLINED OK);
  
  use constant METHOD        => 'EMAIL';
  use constant SMTP_HOSTNAME => "localhost";
  
  sub handler {
      my $r = shift;
  
      return Apache::DECLINED unless $r->method eq METHOD;
  
      Apache::method_register($r->pool, METHOD);
      $r->handler("perl-script");
      $r->push_handlers(PerlResponseHandler => \&send_email_handler);
  
      return Apache::OK;
  }
  
  sub send_email_handler {
      my $r = shift;
  
      my %headers = map {$_ => $r->headers_in->get($_)} qw(To From Subject);
      my $content = content($r);
  
      my $status = send_email(\%headers, \$content);
  
      $r->content_type('text/plain');
      $r->print($status ? "ACK" : "NACK");
      return Apache::OK;
  }
  
  sub content {
      my $r = shift;
  
      $r->setup_client_block;
      return '' unless $r->should_client_block;
      my $len = $r->headers_in->get('content-length');
      my $buf;
      $r->get_client_block($buf, $len);
  
      return $buf;
  }
  
  sub send_email {
      my($rh_headers, $r_body) = @_;
  
      require MIME::Lite;
      MIME::Lite->send("smtp", SMTP_HOSTNAME, Timeout => 60);
  
      my $msg = MIME::Lite->new(%$rh_headers, Data => $$r_body);
      #warn $msg->as_string;
      $msg->send;
  }
  
  1;

Let's get the less interesting code out of the way. The function
content() grabs the request body. The function send_email() sends the
email over SMTP. You should adjust the constant C<SMTP_HOSTNAME> to
point to your outgoing SMTP server. You can replace this function with
your own if you prefer to use a different method to send email.

Now to the more interesting functions. The function C<handler()>
returns immediately and passes the control to the next handler if the
request method is not equal to C<EMAIL> (set in the C<METHOD>
constant):

      return Apache::DECLINED unless $r->method eq METHOD;

Next it tells Apache that this new method is a valid one and that the
C<perl-script> handler will do the processing. Finally it pushes the
function C<send_email_handler()> to the C<PerlResponseHandler> list of
handlers:

      Apache::method_register($r->pool, METHOD);
      $r->handler("perl-script");
      $r->push_handlers(PerlResponseHandler => \&send_email_handler);

The function terminates the header_parser phase by:

      return Apache::OK;

All other phases run as usual, so you can reuse any HTTP protocol
hooks, such as authentication and fixup phases. 

When the response phase starts C<send_email_handler()> is invoked,
assuming that no other response handlers were inserted before it.  The
response handler consists of three parts. Retrieve the email headers
C<To>, C<From> and C<Subject>, and the body of the message:

      my %headers = map {$_ => $r->headers_in->get($_)} qw(To From Subject);
      my $content = $r->content;

Then send the email:

      my $status = send_email(\%headers, \$content);

Finally return to the client a simple response acknowledging that
email has been sent and finish the response phase by returning
C<Apache::OK>:

      $r->content_type('text/plain');
      $r->print($status ? "ACK" : "NACK");
      return Apache::OK;

Of course you will want to add extra validations if you want to use
this code in production. This is just a proof of concept
implementation.

As already mentioned when you extend an HTTP protocol you need to have
a client that knows how to use the extension. So here is a simple
client that uses C<LWP::UserAgent> to issue an C<EMAIL> method request
over HTTP protocol:

  file:send_http_email.pl
  -----------------------
  #!/usr/bin/perl
  
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  
  require LWP::UserAgent;
  
  my $url = "http://localhost:8000/email/";
  
  my %headers = (
      From    => 'example@example.com',
      To      => 'example@example.com',
      Subject => '3 weeks in Tibet',
  );
  
  my $content = <<EOI;
  I didn't have an email software,
  but could use HTTP so I'm sending it over HTTP
  EOI
  
  my $headers = HTTP::Headers->new(%headers);
  my $req = HTTP::Request->new("EMAIL", $url, $headers, $content);
  my $res = LWP::UserAgent->new->request($req);
  print $res->is_success ? $res->content : "failed";

most of the code is just a custom data. The code that does something
consists of four lines at the very end. Create C<HTTP::Headers> and
C<HTTP::Request> object. Issue the request and get the
response. Finally print the response's content if it was successful or
just I<"failed"> if not.

Now save the client code in the file I<send_http_email.pl>, adjust the
I<To> field, make the file executable and execute it, after you have
restarted the server. You should receive an email shortly to the
address set in the I<To> field.



=head2 PerlInitHandler

When configured inside any container directive, except
C<E<lt>VirtualHostE<gt>>, this handler is an alias for
C<L<PerlHeaderParserHandler|/PerlHeaderParserHandler>> described
earlier.  Otherwise it acts as an alias for
C<L<PerlPostReadRequestHandler|/PerlPostReadRequestHandler>> described
earlier.

It is the first handler to be invoked when serving a request.

This phase is of type
C<L<RUN_ALL|docs::2.0::user::handlers::intro/item_RUN_ALL>>.

The best example here would be to use
C<L<Apache::Reload|docs::2.0::api::mod_perl-2.0::Apache::Reload>>
which takes the benefit of this directive. Usually
C<L<Apache::Reload|docs::2.0::api::mod_perl-2.0::Apache::Reload>> is
configured as:

  PerlInitHandler Apache::Reload
  PerlSetVar ReloadAll Off
  PerlSetVar ReloadModules "MyApache::*"

which during the current HTTP request will monitor and reload all
C<MyApache::*> modules that have been modified since the last HTTP
request. However if we move the global configuration into a
C<E<lt>LocationE<gt>> container:

  <Location /devel>
      PerlInitHandler Apache::Reload
      PerlSetVar ReloadAll Off
      PerlSetVar ReloadModules "MyApache::*"
      SetHandler perl-script
      PerlResponseHandler ModPerl::Registry
      Options +ExecCGI
  </Location>

C<L<Apache::Reload|docs::2.0::api::mod_perl-2.0::Apache::Reload>> will
reload the modified modules, only when a request to the I</devel>
namespace is issued, because C<L<PerlInitHandler|/PerlInitHandler>>
plays the role of
C<L<PerlHeaderParserHandler|/PerlHeaderParserHandler>> here.



=head2 PerlAccessHandler

The I<access_checker> phase is the first of three handlers that are
involved in what's known as AAA: Authentication and Authorization, and
Access control.

This phase can be used to restrict access from a certain IP address,
time of the day or any other rule not connected to the user's
identity.

This phase is of type
C<L<RUN_ALL|docs::2.0::user::handlers::intro/item_RUN_ALL>>.

The handler's configuration scope is
C<L<DIR|docs::2.0::user::config::config/item_DIR>>.

The concept behind access checker handler is very simple, return
C<Apache::FORBIDDEN> if the access is not allowed, otherwise return
C<Apache::OK>.

The following example handler denies requests made from IPs on the
blacklist.

  file:MyApache/BlockByIP.pm
  --------------------------
  package MyApache::BlockByIP;
  
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  
  use Apache::RequestRec ();
  use Apache::Connection ();
  
  use Apache::Const -compile => qw(FORBIDDEN OK);
  
  my %bad_ips = map {$_ => 1} qw(127.0.0.1 10.0.0.4);
  
  sub handler {
      my $r = shift;
  
      return exists $bad_ips{$r->connection->remote_ip}
          ? Apache::FORBIDDEN
          : Apache::OK;
  }
  
  1;

The handler retrieves the connection's IP address, looks it up in the
hash of blacklisted IPs and forbids the access if found. If the IP is
not blacklisted, the handler returns control to the next access
checker handler, which may still block the access based on a different
rule.

To enable the handler simply add it to the container that needs to be
protected. For example to protect an access to the registry scripts
executed from the base location I</perl> add:

  <Location /perl/>
      SetHandler perl-script
      PerlResponseHandler ModPerl::Registry
      PerlAccessHandler MyApache::BlockByIP
      Options +ExecCGI
  </Location>

It's important to notice that C<PerlAccessHandler> can be configured
for any subsection of the site, no matter whether it's served by a
mod_perl response handler or not. For example to run the handler from
our example for all requests to the server simply add to
I<httpd.conf>:

  <Location />
      PerlAccessHandler MyApache::BlockByIP
  </Location>


=head2 PerlAuthenHandler

The I<check_user_id> (I<authen>) phase is called whenever the
requested file or directory is password protected.  This, in turn,
requires that the directory be associated with C<AuthName>,
C<AuthType> and at least one C<require> directive.

This phase is usually used to verify a user's identification
credentials. If the credentials are verified to be correct, the
handler should return C<Apache::OK>.  Otherwise the handler returns
C<Apache::AUTH_REQUIRED> to indicate that the user has not
authenticated successfully.  When Apache sends the HTTP header with
this code, the browser will normally pop up a dialog box that prompts
the user for login information.

This phase is of type
C<L<RUN_FIRST|docs::2.0::user::handlers::intro/item_RUN_FIRST>>.

The handler's configuration scope is
C<L<DIR|docs::2.0::user::config::config/item_DIR>>.

The following handler authenticates users by asking for a username and
a password and lets them in only if the length of a string made from
the supplied username and password and a single space equals to the
secret length, specified by the constant C<SECRET_LENGTH>.

  file:MyApache/SecretLengthAuth.pm
  ---------------------------------
  package MyApache::SecretLengthAuth;
  
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  
  use Apache::Access ();
  use Apache::RequestUtil ();
  
  use Apache::Const -compile => qw(OK DECLINED AUTH_REQUIRED);

  use Apache::Access();
  
  use constant SECRET_LENGTH => 14;
  
  sub handler {
      my $r = shift;
  
      my ($status, $password) = $r->get_basic_auth_pw;
      return $status unless $status == Apache::OK;
  
      return Apache::OK 
          if SECRET_LENGTH == length join " ", $r->user, $password;
  
      $r->note_basic_auth_failure;
      return Apache::AUTH_REQUIRED;
  }
  
  1;

First the handler retrieves the status of the authentication and the
password in plain text. The status will be set to C<Apache::OK> only
when the user has supplied the username and the password
credentials. If the status is different, we just let Apache handle
this situation for us, which will usually challenge the client so
it'll supply the credentials.

Once we know that we have the username and the password supplied by
the client, we can proceed with the authentication. Our authentication
algorithm is unusual. Instead of validating the username/password pair
against a password file, we simply check that the string built from
these two items plus a single space is C<SECRET_LENGTH> long (14 in
our example). So for example the pair I<mod_perl/rules> authenticates
correctly, whereas I<secret/password> does not, because the latter
pair will make a string of 15 characters. Of course this is not a
strong authentication scheme and you shouldn't use it for serious
things, but it's fun to play with. Most authentication validations
simply verify the username/password against a database of valid pairs,
usually this requires the password to be encrypted first, since
storing passwords in clear is a bad idea.

Finally if our authentication fails the handler calls
note_basic_auth_failure() and returns C<Apache::AUTH_REQUIRED>, which
sets the proper HTTP response headers that tell the client that its
user that the authentication has failed and the credentials should be
supplied again.

It's not enough to enable this handler for the authentication to
work. You have to tell Apache what authentication scheme to use
(C<Basic> or C<Digest>), which is specified by the C<AuthType>
directive, and you should also supply the C<AuthName> -- the
authentication realm, which is really just a string that the client
usually uses as a title in the pop-up box, where the username and the
password are inserted. Finally the C<Require> directive is needed to
specify which usernames are allowed to authenticate. If you set it to
C<valid-user> any username will do.

Here is the whole configuration section that requires users to
authenticate before they are allowed to run the registry scripts from
I</perl/>:

  <Location /perl/>
      SetHandler perl-script
      PerlResponseHandler ModPerl::Registry
      PerlAuthenHandler MyApache::SecretLengthAuth
      Options +ExecCGI
  
      AuthType Basic
      AuthName "The Gate"
      Require valid-user
  </Location>

Just like C<PerlAccessHandler> and other mod_perl handlers,
C<PerlAuthenHandler> can be configured for any subsection of the site,
no matter whether it's served by a mod_perl response handler or
not. For example to use the authentication handler from the last
example for any requests to the site, simply use:

  <Location />
      PerlAuthenHandler MyApache::SecretLengthAuth
      AuthType Basic
      AuthName "The Gate"
      Require valid-user
  </Location>



=head2 PerlAuthzHandler

The I<auth_checker> (I<authz>) phase is used for authorization
control. This phase requires a successful authentication from the
previous phase, because a username is needed in order to decide
whether a user is authorized to access the requested resource.

As this phase is tightly connected to the authentication phase, the
handlers registered for this phase are only called when the requested
resource is password protected, similar to the auth phase. The handler
is expected to return C<Apache::DECLINED> to defer the decision,
C<Apache::OK> to indicate its acceptance of the user's authorization,
or C<Apache::AUTH_REQUIRED> to indicate that the user is not
authorized to access the requested document.

This phase is of type
C<L<RUN_FIRST|docs::2.0::user::handlers::intro/item_RUN_FIRST>>.

The handler's configuration scope is
C<L<DIR|docs::2.0::user::config::config/item_DIR>>.

Here is the C<MyApache::SecretResourceAuthz> handler which grants
access to certain resources only to certain users who have already
properly authenticated:

  file:MyApache/SecretResourceAuthz.pm
  ------------------------------------
  package MyApache::SecretResourceAuthz;
  
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  
  use Apache::Access ();
  use Apache::RequestUtil ();
  
  use Apache::Const -compile => qw(OK AUTH_REQUIRED);

  use Apache::Access ();
  
  my %protected = (
      'admin'  => ['stas'],
      'report' => [qw(stas boss)],
  );
  
  sub handler {
      my $r = shift;
  
      my $user = $r->user;
      if ($user) {
          my($section) = $r->uri =~ m|^/company/(\w+)/|;
          if (defined $section && exists $protected{$section}) {
              my $users = $protected{$section};
              return Apache::OK if grep { $_ eq $user } @$users;
          }
          else {
              return Apache::OK;
          }
      }
  
      $r->note_basic_auth_failure;
      return Apache::AUTH_REQUIRED;
  }
  
  1;

This authorization handler is very similar to the authentication
handler L<from the previous section|/PerlAuthenHandler>. Here we rely
on the previous phase to get users authenticated, and now as we have
the username we can make decisions whether to let the user access the
resource it has asked for or not. In our example we have a simple hash
which maps which users are allowed to access what resources. So for
example anything under I</company/admin/> can be accessed only by the
user I<stas>, I</company/report/> can be accessed by users I<stas> and
I<boss>, whereas any other resources under I</company/> can be
accessed by everybody who has reached so far. If for some reason we
don't get the username, we or the user is not authorized to access the
resource the handler does the same thing as it does when the
authentication fails, i.e, calls:

      $r->note_basic_auth_failure;
      return Apache::AUTH_REQUIRED;

The configuration is similar to the one in L<the previous
section|/PerlAuthenHandler>, this time we just add the 
C<PerlAuthzHandler> setting. The rest doesn't change.

      PerlAuthzHandler  MyApache::SecretResourceAuthz
      Options +ExecCGI
  
      AuthType Basic
      AuthName "The Secret Gate"
      Require valid-user
  </Location>

And if you want to run the authentication and authorization for the
whole site, simply add:

  <Location />
      PerlAuthenHandler MyApache::SecretLengthAuth
      PerlAuthzHandler  MyApache::SecretResourceAuthz
      AuthType Basic
      AuthName "The Secret Gate"
      Require valid-user
  </Location>



=head2 PerlTypeHandler

The I<type_checker> phase is used to set the response MIME type
(C<Content-type>) and sometimes other bits of document type
information like the document language.

For example C<mod_autoindex>, which performs automatic directory
indexing, uses this phase to map the filename extensions to the
corresponding icons which will be later used in the listing of files.

Of course later phases may override the mime type set in this phase.

This phase is of type
C<L<RUN_FIRST|docs::2.0::user::handlers::intro/item_RUN_FIRST>>.

The handler's configuration scope is
C<L<DIR|docs::2.0::user::config::config/item_DIR>>.

The most important thing to remember when overriding the default
I<type_checker> handler, which is usually the mod_mime handler, is
that you have to set the handler that will take care of the response
phase and the response callback function or the code won't
work. mod_mime does that based on C<SetHandler> and C<AddHandler>
directives, and file extensions. So if you want the content handler to
be run by mod_perl, set either:

  $r->handler('perl-script');
  $r->set_handlers(PerlResponseHandler => \&handler);

or:

  $r->handler('modperl');
  $r->set_handlers(PerlResponseHandler => \&handler);

depending on which type of response handler is wanted.

Writing a C<PerlTypeHandler> handler which sets the content-type value
and returns C<Apache::DECLINED> so that the default handler will do
the rest of the work, is not a good idea, because mod_mime will
probably override this and other settings.

Therefore it's the easiest to leave this stage alone and do any
desired settings in the I<fixups> phase.




=head2 PerlFixupHandler

The I<fixups> phase is happening just before the content handling
phase. It gives the last chance to do things before the response is
generated. For example in this phase C<mod_env> populates the
environment with variables configured with I<SetEnv> and I<PassEnv>
directives.

This phase is of type
C<L<RUN_ALL|docs::2.0::user::handlers::intro/item_RUN_ALL>>.

The handler's configuration scope is
C<L<DIR|docs::2.0::user::config::config/item_DIR>>.

The following fixup handler example tells Apache at run time which
handler and callback should be used to process the request based on
the file extension of the request's URI.

  file:MyApache/FileExtDispatch.pm
  --------------------------------
  package MyApache::FileExtDispatch;
  
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  
  use Apache::RequestIO ();
  use Apache::RequestRec ();
  
  use Apache::Const -compile => 'OK';
  
  use constant HANDLER  => 0;
  use constant CALLBACK => 1;
  
  my %exts = (
      cgi => ['perl-script',     \&cgi_handler],
      pl  => ['modperl',         \&pl_handler ],
      tt  => ['perl-script',     \&tt_handler ],
      txt => ['default-handler', undef        ],
  );
  
  sub handler {
      my $r = shift;
  
      my($ext) = $r->uri =~ /\.(\w+)$/;
      $ext = 'txt' unless defined $ext and exists $exts{$ext};
  
      $r->handler($exts{$ext}->[HANDLER]);
  
      if (defined $exts{$ext}->[CALLBACK]) {
          $r->set_handlers(PerlResponseHandler => $exts{$ext}->[CALLBACK]);
      }
  
      return Apache::OK;
  }
  
  sub cgi_handler { content_handler($_[0], 'cgi') }
  sub pl_handler  { content_handler($_[0], 'pl')  }
  sub tt_handler  { content_handler($_[0], 'tt')  }
  
  sub content_handler {
      my($r, $type) = @_;
  
      $r->content_type('text/plain');
      $r->print("A handler of type '$type' was called");
  
      return Apache::OK;
  }
  
  1;

In the example we have used the following mapping.

  my %exts = (
      cgi => ['perl-script',     \&cgi_handler],
      pl  => ['modperl',         \&pl_handler ],
      tt  => ['perl-script',     \&tt_handler ],
      txt => ['default-handler', undef        ],
  );

So that I<.cgi> requests will be handled by the C<perl-script> handler
and the C<cgi_handler()> callback, I<.pl> requests by C<modperl> and
C<pl_handler()>, I<.tt> (template toolkit) by C<perl-script> and the
C<tt_handler()>, finally I<.txt> request by the C<default-handler>
handler, which requires no callback.

Moreover the handler assumes that if the request's URI has no file
extension or it does, but it's not in its mapping, the
C<default-handler> will be used, as if the I<txt> extension was used.

After doing the mapping, the handler assigns the handler:

      $r->handler($exts{$ext}->[HANDLER]);

and the callback if needed:

      if (defined $exts{$ext}->[CALLBACK]) {
          $r->set_handlers(PerlResponseHandler => $exts{$ext}->[CALLBACK]);
      }

In this simple example the callback functions don't do much but
calling the same content handler which simply prints the name of the
extension if handled by mod_perl, otherwise Apache will serve the
other files using the default handler. In real world you will use
callbacks to real content handlers that do real things.

Here is how this handler is configured:

  Alias /dispatch/ /home/httpd/httpd-2.0/htdocs/
  <Location /dispatch/>
      PerlFixupHandler MyApache::FileExtDispatch
  </Location>

Notice that there is no need to specify anything, but the fixup
handler. It applies the rest of the settings dynamically at run-time.




=head2 PerlResponseHandler

The I<handler> (I<response>) phase is used for generating the
response. This is arguably the most important phase and most of the
existing Apache modules do most of their work at this phase.

This is the only phase that requires two directives under
mod_perl. For example:

  <Location /perl>
     SetHandler perl-script
     PerlResponseHandler ModPerl::Registry
  </Location>

C<SetHandler> set to
C<L<perl-script|docs::2.0::user::config::config/C_perl_script_>> or
C<L<modperl|docs::2.0::user::config::config/C_modperl_>> tells Apache
that mod_perl is going to handle the response
generation. C<PerlResponseHandler> tells mod_perl which callback is
going to do the job.

This phase is of type
C<L<RUN_FIRST|docs::2.0::user::handlers::intro/item_RUN_FIRST>>.

The handler's configuration scope is
C<L<DIR|docs::2.0::user::config::config/item_DIR>>.

Most of the C<Apache::> modules on CPAN are dealing with this
phase. In fact most of the developers spend the majority of their time
working on handlers that generate response content.

Let's write a simple response handler, that just generates some
content. This time let's do something more interesting than printing
I<"Hello world">. Let's write a handler that prints itself:

  file:MyApache/Deparse.pm
  ------------------------
  package MyApache::Deparse;
  
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  
  use Apache::RequestRec ();
  use Apache::RequestIO ();
  use B::Deparse ();
  
  use Apache::Const -compile => 'OK';
  
  sub handler {
      my $r = shift;
  
      $r->content_type('text/plain');
      $r->print('sub handler ', B::Deparse->new->coderef2text(\&handler));
  
      return Apache::OK;
  }
  1;

To enable this handler add to I<httpd.conf>:

  <Location /deparse>
      SetHandler modperl
      PerlResponseHandler MyApache::Deparse
  </Location>

Now when the server is restarted and we issue a request to
I<http://localhost/deparse> we get the following response:

  sub handler {
      package MyApache::Deparse;
      my $r = shift @_;
      $r->content_type('text/plain');
      $r->print('sub handler ', 'B::Deparse'->new->coderef2text(\&handler));
      return 0;
  }

If you compare it to the source code, it's pretty much the same
code. C<B::Deparse> is fun to play with!



=head2 PerlLogHandler

The I<log_transaction> phase happens no matter how the previous phases
have ended up. If one of the earlier phases has aborted a request,
e.g., failed authentication or 404 (file not found) errors, the rest of
the phases up to and including the response phases are skipped. But
this phase is always executed.

By this phase all the information about the request and the response
is known, therefore the logging handlers usually record this
information in various ways (e.g., logging to a flat file or a
database).

This phase is of type
C<L<RUN_ALL|docs::2.0::user::handlers::intro/item_RUN_ALL>>.

The handler's configuration scope is
C<L<DIR|docs::2.0::user::config::config/item_DIR>>.

Imagine a situation where you have to log requests into individual
files, one per user. Assuming that all requests start with
I</users/username/>, so it's easy to categorize requests by the second
URI path component. Here is the log handler that does that:

  file:MyApache/LogPerUser.pm
  ---------------------------
  package MyApache::LogPerUser;
  
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  
  use Apache::RequestRec ();
  use Apache::Connection ();
  use Fcntl qw(:flock);
  
  use Apache::Const -compile => qw(OK DECLINED);
  
  sub handler {
      my $r = shift;
  
      my($username) = $r->uri =~ m|^/users/([^/]+)|;
      return Apache::DECLINED unless defined $username;
  
      my $entry = sprintf qq(%s [%s] "%s" %d %d\n),
          $r->connection->remote_ip, scalar(localtime),
          $r->uri, $r->status, $r->bytes_sent;
  
      my $log_path = Apache::server_root_relative($r->pool, 
          "logs/$username.log");
      open my $fh, ">>$log_path" or die "can't open $log_path: $!";
      flock $fh, LOCK_EX;
      print $fh $entry;
      close $fh;
  
      return Apache::OK;
  }
  1;

First the handler tries to figure out what username the request is
issued for, if it fails to match the URI, it simply returns
C<Apache::DECLINED>, letting other log handlers to do the
logging. Though it could return C<Apache::OK> since all other log
handlers will be run anyway.

Next it builds the log entry, similar to the default I<access_log>
entry. It's comprised of remote IP, the current time, the uri, the
return status and how many bytes were sent to the client as a response
body.

Finally the handler appends this entry to the log file for the user
the request was issued for. Usually it's safe to append short strings
to the file without being afraid of messing up the file, when two
files attempt to write at the same time, but just to be on the safe
side the handler exclusively locks the file before performing the
writing.

To configure the handler simply enable the module with the
C<PerlLogHandler> directive, inside the wanted section, which was
I</users/> in our example:

  <Location /users/>
      SetHandler perl-script
      PerlResponseHandler ModPerl::Registry
      PerlLogHandler MyApache::LogPerUser
      Options +ExecCGI
  </Location>

After restarting the server and issuing requests to the following
URIs:

  http://localhost/users/stas/test.pl
  http://localhost/users/eric/test.pl
  http://localhost/users/stas/date.pl

The C<MyApache::LogPerUser> handler will append to I<logs/stas.log>:

  127.0.0.1 [Sat Aug 31 01:50:38 2002] "/users/stas/test.pl" 200 8
  127.0.0.1 [Sat Aug 31 01:50:40 2002] "/users/stas/date.pl" 200 44

and to I<logs/eric.log>:

  127.0.0.1 [Sat Aug 31 01:50:39 2002] "/users/eric/test.pl" 200 8

It's important to notice that C<PerlLogHandler> can be configured for
any subsection of the site, no matter whether it's served by a
mod_perl response handler or not. For example to run the handler from
our example for all requests to the server, simply add to
I<httpd.conf>:

  <Location />
      PerlLogHandler MyApache::LogPerUser
  </Location>

Since the C<PerlLogHandler> phase is of type
C<L<RUN_ALL|docs::2.0::user::handlers::intro/item_RUN_ALL>>, all other
logging handlers will be called as well.
