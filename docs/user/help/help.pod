=head1 NAME

User Help

=head1 Description

This chapter is for those needing help using mod_perl and related
software.

There is a parallel L<Getting Help|devel::help::help> document written
mainly for mod_perl core developers, but may be found useful to
non-core problems as well.

=head1 Reporting Problems

Whenever you want to report a bug or a problem remember that in order
to help you, you need to provide us the information about the software
that you are using and other relevant details. Please follow the
instructions in the following sections when reporting problems.

=head2 Wrong Apache/mod_perl combination

First of all:

  Apache 2.0 doesn't work with mod_perl 1.0.
  Apache 1.0 doesn't work with mod_perl 2.0.

So if you aren't using Apache 2.x with mod_perl 2.0 please do not send
any bug reports.

=head2 Use a Proper Subject

Make sure to include a good subject like explaining the problem in a
few words. Also please mention that this a problem with mod_perl 2.0
and not mod_perl 1.0. Here is an example of a good subject:

  Subject: [mp2.0] protocol module doesn't work with filters

This is especially important now that we support mod_perl versions 1.0
and 2.0 on the same list.

=head2 Important Information

Whenever you send a bug report make sure to include the information
about your system by doing the following:

  % cd modperl-2.0
  % t/REPORT > mybugreport

where C<modperl-2.0> is the source directory where mod_perl was built.
The <t/REPORT> utility is autogenerated when C<perl Makefile.PL> is
run, so you should have it already after building mod_perl.

Now add the problem description to the report and send it to the
L<list|maillist::modperl>.

META: soon we will have C<modperlbug> report script which will be
installed system-wide

=head2 Problem Description

If the problem incurs with your own code, please try to reduce the
code to the very minimum and include it in the bug report. Remember
that if you include a long code, chances that somebody will look at it
are low. If the problem is with some CPAN module, just provide its
name.

Also remember to include the relevant part of I<httpd.conf> and of
I<startup.pl> if applicable. Don't include whole files, only the parts
that should aid to understand and reproduce the problem.

=head2 Resolving Segmentation Faults

If during C<make test> or the use of mod_perl you get a segmentation
fault you should send to the list a stack backtrace. This
L<section|devel::debug_c::debug_c/Analyzing_Dumped_Core_Files>
explains how to extract this backtrace.

Of course to generate a useful backtrace you need to have mod_perl
with debugging symbols in it (and probably perl and/or httpd too).

To get debug symbols for :

=over

=item * mod_perl

rebuild mod_perl with C<MP_DEBUG=1>.

  % perl Makefile.PL MP_DEBUG=1 ...
  % make && make test && make install

=item * httpd

use C<--enable-maintainer-mode>:

  % ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode ...
  % make && make install

=item * perl

use C<-Doptimize='-g'>:

  % ./Configure -Doptimize='-g' ...
  % make && make test && make install

=item * 3rd party perl modules

if the trace happens in one of the 3rd party perl modules, make sure
to rebuild them, now that you've perl re-built with debugging
flags. They will automatically pick the right compile flags from perl.

=back

Once a proper stack backtrace is obtained append it to the bug report
as explained in the previous section.

=head2 Please Ask Only Questions Related to mod_perl

If you have general Apache questions, please refer to:
http://httpd.apache.org/lists.html.

If you have general Perl questions, please refer to:
http://lists.perl.org/.

For other remotely related to mod_perl questions see the references to
L<other documentation|docs::offisite::other>.

Finally, if you are posting to the list for the first time, please
refer to the mod_perl mailing lists'
L<Guidelines|maillist::email-etiquette>.
