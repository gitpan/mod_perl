User Help

=head1 Description

This chapter is for those needing help using mod_perl and related
software.

There is a parallel L<Getting Help|devel::help::help> document written
mainly for mod_perl core developers, but may be found useful to
non-core problems as well.

=head1 Reporting Problems

Whenever you want to report a bug or a problem remember that in order
to help you need to provide us the information about the software
blocks that you are using. This is especially important now that we
support mod_perl versions 1.x and 2.x on the same list.

=head2 Wrong Apache/mod_perl combination

First of all:

  Apache 2.x doesn't work with mod_perl 1.x.
  Apache 1.x doesn't work with mod_perl 2.x.

So if you aren't using Apache 2.x with mod_perl 2.x please do not
send any bug reports.

=head2 Minimum Information

Whenever you send a bug report make sure to include the information
about your system by doing the following:

  % cd modperl-2.0
  % t/REPORT > mybugreport

(this utility is autogenerated when C<perl Makefile.PL> is run.)

Now add the problem description to the report and send it to the
L<list|maillist::modperl>.

META: soon we will have C<modperlbug> report script which will be
installed system-wide

=head2 Resolving Segmentation Faults

If during C<make test> or the use of mod_perl you get a segmentation
fault you should send to the list a stack backtrace. This
L<section|devel::debug_c::debug_c/Analyzing_Dumped_Core_Files>
explains how to extract this backtrace.

Of course to generate a useful backtrace you need to have mod_perl
with debugging symbols in it (and probably perl and/or httpd too).

To get debug symbols for :

=over

=item * mod_perl

rebuild mod_perl with C<MP_DEBUG=1>.

  % perl Makefile.PL MP_DEBUG=1 ...
  % make && make test && make install

=item * httpd

use C<--enable-maintainer-mode>:

  % ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode ...
  % make && make install

=item * perl

use C<-Doptimize='-g'>:

  % ./Configure -Doptimize='-g' ...
  % make && make test && make install

=back

Once a proper stack backtrace is obtained append it to the bug report
as explained in the previous section.


=head1 Maintainers

Maintainer is the person(s) you should contact with updates,
corrections and patches.
