=head1 NAME

Coding with and for mod_perl

=head1 Description

This chapter covers the mod_perl coding specifics, different from normal Perl coding.

=head1 Prerequisites

=head1 Goodies Toolkit

=head2 Environment Variables

mod_perl sets the following environment variables:

=over

=item * 

C<MOD_PERL> - is set to the mod_perl version the server is running
under. e.g.:

  mod_perl/1.99_03-dev

If this C<$ENV{MOD_PERL}> doesn't exist, most likely you are
not running under mod_perl.

=item *

C<GATEWAY_INTERFACE> - is set to C<CGI-Perl/1.1> for compatibility
with mod_perl 1.0. This variable is deprecated in mod_perl 2.0. Use
C<MOD_PERL> instead.

=back

mod_perl passes (exports) the following shell environment variables
(if they are set) :

=over

=item * 

C<PATH> - Executables search path.

=item * 

C<TZ> - Time Zone.

=back

Any of these environment variables can be accessed via C<%ENV>.

=head2 Threaded MPM or not?

If the code needs to behave differently depending on whether it's
running under one of the threaded MPMs, or not, the
C<Apache::MPM_IS_THREADED> constant can be used. For example:

  if (Apache::MPM_IS_THREADED) {
      my $id = APR::OS::thread_current();
      print "current thread id: $id";
  }
  else {
      print "current process id: $$";
  }

This code prints the current thread id if running under a threaded
MPM, otherwise it prints the process id.


=head1 Code Developing Nuances

=head2 Auto-Reloading Modified Modules with Apache::Reload

META: need to port Apache::Reload notes from the guide here. but the
gist is:

  PerlModule Apache::Reload
  PerlInitHandler Apache::Reload
  PerlSetVar ReloadAll Off
  PerlSetVar ReloadModules "ModPerl::* Apache::*"

Though notice that we have started to practice the following style in
our modules:

  package Apache::Whatever;
  
  use strict;
  use warnings FATAL => 'all';

C<FATAL =E<gt> 'all'> escalates all warnings into fatal errors. So
when C<Apache::Whatever> is modified and reloaded by C<Apache::Reload>
the request is aborted. Therefore if you follow this very healthy
style and want to use C<Apache::Reload>, flex the strictness by
changing it to:

  use warnings FATAL => 'all';
  no warnings 'redefine';

but you probably still want to get the I<redefine> warnings, but
downgrade them to be non-fatal. The following will do the trick:

  use warnings FATAL => 'all';
  no warnings 'redefine';
  use warnings 'redefine';

Perl 5.8.0 allows to do all this in one line:

  use warnings FATAL => 'all', NONFATAL => 'redefine';

Refer to the I<perllexwarn> manpage for more information.

=head1 Perl Specifics in mod_perl Environment

In the following sections we discuss the specifics of Perl behavior
under mod_perl.

=head2 Request-localized Globals

Under the handler:

  SetHandler perl-script

Several special global Perl variables are saved before the handler is
called and restored afterwards. This includes: C<%ENV>, C<@INC>,
C<$/>, C<STDOUT>'s C<$|> and C<END> blocks array (C<PL_endav>).

Under:

  SetHandler modperl

nothing is restored, so you should be especially careful to remember
localize all special Perl variables so the local changes won't affect
other handlers.

=head2 exit()

In the normal Perl code exit() is used to stop the program flow and
exit the Perl interpreter. However under mod_perl we only want the
stop the program flow without killing the Perl interpreter.

You should take no action if your code includes exit() calls and it's
OK to continue using them. mod_perl worries to override the exit()
function with its own version which stops the program flow, and
performs all the necessary cleanups, but doesn't kill the server. This
is done by overriding:

  *CORE::GLOBAL::exit = \&ModPerl::Util::exit;

so if you mess up with C<*CORE::GLOBAL::exit> yourself you better know
what you are doing.

You can still call C<CORE::exit> to kill the interpreter, again if you
know what you are doing.


=head1 Threads Coding Issues Under mod_perl

The following sections discuss threading issues when running mod_perl
under a threaded MPM.

=head2 Thread-environment Issues

The "only" thing you have to worry about your code is that it's
thread-safe and that you don't use functions that affect all threads
in the same process.

Perl 5.8.0 itself is a thread-safe. That means that operations like
C<push()>, C<map()>, C<chomp()>, C<=>, C</>, C<+=>, etc. are
thread-safe. Operations that involve system calls, may or may not be
thread-safe. It all depends on whether the underlying C libraries used
by the perl functions are thread-safe.

For example the function C<localtime()> is not thread-safe when the
implementation of C<asctime(3)> is not thread-safe. Other usually
problematic functions include C<readdir()>, C<srand()>, etc.

Another important issue that shouldn't be missed is what some people
refer to as I<thread-locality>. Certain functions executed in a single
thread affect the whole process and therefore all other threads
running inside that process. For example if you C<chdir()> in one
thread, all other thread now see the current working directory of that
thread that C<chdir()>'ed to that directory. Other functions with
similar effects include C<umask()>, C<chroot()>, etc. Currently there
is no cure for this problem. You have to find these functions in your
code and replace them with alternative solutions which don't incur
this problem.

For more information refer to the I<perlthrtut>
(I<http://perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/pod/perlthrtut.html>) manpage.


=head2 Deploying Threads

This is actually quite unrelated to mod_perl 2.0. You don't have to
know much about Perl threads, other than L<Thread-environment
Issues|/Thread_environment_Issues>, to have your code properly work 
under threaded MPM mod_perl.

If you want to spawn your own threads, first of all study how the new
ithreads Perl model works, by reading the I<perlthrtut>, I<threads>
(I<http://search.cpan.org/search?query=threads>) and
I<threads::shared>
(I<http://search.cpan.org/search?query=threads%3A%3Ashared>) manpages.

Artur Bergman wrote an article which explains how to port pure Perl
modules to work properly with Perl ithreads. Issues with C<chdir()>
and other functions that rely on shared process' datastructures are
discussed.  I<http://www.perl.com/lpt/a/2002/06/11/threads.html>.


=head2 Shared Variables

Global variables are only global to the interpreter in which they are
created. Other interpreters from other threads can't access that
variable. Though it's possible to make existing variables shared
between several threads running in the same process by using the
function C<threads::shared::share()>. New variables can be shared by
using the I<shared> attribute when creating them. This feature is
documented in the I<threads::shared>
(I<http://search.cpan.org/search?query=threads%3A%3Ashared>) manpage.
