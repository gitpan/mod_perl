mod_perl 2.0 Win32 Installation Instructions

=head1 Description

This document deals with installation specifics on Win32 platforms.

As described in the discussion of issues in L<multithreaded
win32|docs::1.0::os::win32::multithread>, a mod_perl 1.0 enabled server
based on Apache 1.3 on Win32 is limited to a single thread serving a
request at a time. This effectively prevents concurrent processing,
which can have serious implications for busy sites. This problem is
addressed in the multi-thread/multi-process approach of mod_perl
2.0/Apache 2.0.  This document discusses how to obtain mod_perl 2.0.

=head1 Installing

As of this writing, mod_perl-2 is known to compile and work
with an ActivePerl-compatable Perl (builds 6xx), based on
perl-5.6.1. It also works with perl-5.8 compiled with the
default compile-time flags in the Win32 F<Makefile>. Because of
improved threading support, it is expected sometime in the future
that perl-5.8 will be the recommended Perl for Win32 mod_perl-2.

Apache 2.0 and mod_perl 2.0 can be obtained in two ways - either as
binaries, or through building from the sources.  As with most packages
of a more complex nature, it is best, when possible, to build things
from the sources. However, this requires some experience with using
Visual C++.

=head2 Building from sources

If you are building mod_perl 2.0 from sources, it is probably also
best to do the same for Apache 2.0. The Apache 2.0 sources can be
obtained from http://httpd.apache.org/, which when unpacked will
contain at the top-level a Visual Studio project file. Choose the
C<InstallBin - Win32 Release> target to build and install Apache 2.0,
which by default will be placed in F</Apache2>.

Having built and installed Apache 2.0, next obtain the mod_perl 2.0
sources from http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/D/DO/DOUGM/.  After
unpacking, run the command

    C:\modperl_src> perl Makefile.PL MP_AP_PREFIX=\Path\to\Apache2

where F<\Path\to\Apache2> is the path to the Apache 2.0 package you
earlier built. Then

    C:\modperl_src> nmake
    C:\modperl_src> nmake test

will build and test mod_perl 2.0. mod_perl 2.0 on Win32 is considered
at an alpha stage of development, so not all the tests may pass.

The final command,

    C:\modperl_src> nmake install

will install the necessary mod_perl 2.0 files into your Perl directory
tree (you will also need to copy F<src/modules/perl/mod_perl.so> into
your F</Path/to/Apache2/modules/> directory). If you are installing
mod_perl 2.0 on a system that also contains mod_perl 1.0, then some
mod_perl 1.0 files will be overwritten by this procedure. This can be
avoided by preparing the build as

  C:\modperl_src> perl Makefile.PL MP_AP_PREFIX=\Path\to\Apache2 MP_INST_APACHE2=1

which will subsequently lead to the mod_perl 2.0 files being installed
under an F<Apache2> subdirectory in your Perl tree.  You will then
have to employ either a C<use Apache2;> line in your scripts/packages
or else a C<PerlModule Apache2> directive in Apache's F<httpd.conf>.

If this build fails, or you want features not present in the
official releases, you may want to try the sources obtained
from cvs (it is a good idea to also use the cvs httpd-2.0 sources).
To do this, first obtain a Win32 cvs client from, for example,
http://www.cvshome.org/. The cvs sources may be obtained as

  C:\src> cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic login
  C:\src> cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic co httpd-2.0
  C:\src> cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic co modperl-2.0

The build then proceeds as above. Be aware, though,
that as well as providing bug fixes, there may be new features being
added and tested in the cvs versions, so at any given time there are
no guarantees that these packages will build and test successfully.

=head2 Binary packages

There are two ways of obtaining a binary mod_perl 2.0 package.

=over 3

=item PPM

The first, for ActivePerl users, is through C<PPM> - this assumes you
already have ActivePerl (build 6xx) from http://www.activestate.com/
and a Win32 Apache 2.0 binary from http://httpd.apache.org/. In
installing this, you may find it convenient when transcribing any
Unix-oriented documentation to choose installation directories that do
not have spaces in their names (eg, F<C:/Apache2>).

After installing Perl and Apache 2.0, you can then install mod_perl
via the C<PPM> utility. ActiveState does not maintain mod_perl in
their ppm repository, so you must get it from a different location
other than ActiveState's site. One way is simply as (broken over two
lines for readability)

  C:\> ppm install
       http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppmpackages/mod_perl-2.ppd

Another way, which will be useful if you plan on installing additional
Apache modules, is to set the repository within the C<ppm> shell
utility as (broken over 2 lines for readability)

   PPM> set repository theoryx5 
         http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/cgi-bin/ppmserver?urn:/PPMServer

or, for C<ppm3>,

   PPM> rep add theoryx5 
         http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/cgi-bin/ppmserver?urn:/PPMServer

mod_perl 2.0 can then be installed as

   PPM> install mod_perl-2

This will install the necessary modules under an F<Apache2>
subdirectory in your Perl tree, so as not to disturb an existing
F<Apache> directory from mod_perl 1.0. See the section below on
configuring mod_perl to add this directory to the C<@INC> path for
searching for modules.

The mod_perl PPM package also includes the necessary Apache DLL
C<mod_perl.so>; a post-installation script should be run which will
offer to copy this file to your Apache2 modules directory (eg,
F<C:/Apache2/modules/>). If this is not done, you can get the file
F<mod_perl-2.tar.gz> from
http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppmpackages/x86/ which, when unpacked,
contains F<mod_perl.so> in the top-level directory.

Note that the mod_perl package available from this site will always
use the latest mod_perl sources compiled against the latest official
Apache release; depending on changes made in Apache, you may or may
not be able to use an earlier Apache binary. However, in the Apache
Win32 world it is particularly a good idea to use the latest version,
for bug and security fixes.

=item Apache/mod_perl binary

At ftp://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/pub/other/ one can find an archive
F<Apache2.tar.gz> containing a binary version of Apache 2.0/mod_perl
2.0 - see the F<Apache2.readme> file for further information. This
archive unpacks into an F<Apache2> directory, underneath which is a
F<blib> subdirectory containing the necessary mod_perl files (enabled
with a C<PerlSwitches> directive in F<httpd.conf>).  Some editing of
F<httpd.conf> will be necessary to reflect the location of the
installed directory.

This package, which is updated periodically, is compiled against
recent cvs sources of Apache 2.0 and mod_perl 2.0. As such, it may
contain features, and bugs, not present in the current official
releases. Also for this reason, these may not be binary compatible
with other versions of Apache 2.0/mod_perl 2.0.

As well, at ftp://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/pub/other/ there is an
archive F<perl-5.8-win32-bin.tar.gz> containing a binary version
of a release candidate of perl-5.8, together with Apache 2.0
and mod_perl 2.0. Installation instructions are contained in
the file F<perl-5.8-win32-bin.readme>. Although at this time
perl-5.8 is not yet stable, you may be interested in previewing
it, as once it is stable, this will be the recommended Perl version
for use with Win32 mod_perl 2.0.
