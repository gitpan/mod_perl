release 0.84 - October 27, 1996

I have uploaded the latest version of the Apache-Perl modules to PAUSE.
While the package is making it's way around CPAN, it is also available from:
http://www.osf.org/~dougm/apache/

There have been many changes since the last announcement (0.81) including:

The original approach of mod_perl has been abandoned in favor of 
the mod_perl_fast mechanism.  To complete this transition
mod_perl_fast has been renamed to mod_perl.

Callback hooks have been added for the remaining stages of a request, 
in addition to the handler stage, Apache-Perl modules may now step in 
during the uri translate, authentication, authorization, access, type check,
fixup and logger stages of a request.   

A configuration directive has been added for each stage to define a
subroutine callback handler:

    PerlTransHandler    
    PerlAuthenHandler
    PerlAuthzHandler
    PerlAccessHandler
    PerlTypeHandler
    PerlFixupHandler
    PerlLogHandler

New configuration directive 'SetPerlVar' allows users to set variables in
configuration files, made available to perl with the $r->dir_config method.

New modules include:
    Apache::AuthenDBI      - Authenticate via Perl's DBI
    Apache::Authen         - Perl Apache authentication handlers
    Apache::AuthzAge       - Authorize based on age
    Apache::AccessLimitNum - Limit user access by number of requests
    Apache::Constants      - Constants defined in httpd.h
    Apache::MsqlProxy      - Translate URI's into mSQL database queries

More API functionality made available to perl:
    $r->dir_config
    $r->get_basic_auth_pw
    $r->note_basic_auth_failure
    $r->requires
    $r->main
    $r->is_main
    $r->handler
    $r->proxyreq

Adjustments have been made to come in-line with Apache-1.2-dev.

Installation procedure has been reworked such that is follows recommendations
for apache 1.2 modules.

Other assorted bug fixes and updates, see the 'Changes' file for details.

Regards,
-Doug
