Most of the show-stopping bugs have been stomped out, moving us into
beta.  These modules have been viewed as a way to speed-up CGI type
applications, but it is also possible to write Apache modules in Perl
for things such as server-side includes.  
A new module 'Apache::SSI' is included as an example of this functionality.
It provides the same functionality as mod_include (almost), but it is
easily extendible by subclassing Apache::SSI or defining Apache::SSI
directive handlers.
Writing this module was extra simple thanks to Gisle's fantastic 
HTML::* modules.

The package has been uploaded to CPAN and is also available at:
http://www.osf.org/~dougm/apache/mod_perl-0.70b1.tar.gz

Here are some of the changes:
o applied patch from Andreas Koenig <k@anna.in-berlin.de> to fix 
  Makefile.tmpl bug, typos and documentation clean-up

o Added Apache::SSI module for server side includes

o Added 'PerlModule' directive for loading modules in srm.conf

o fixed read_client_block bug that was causing trailing garbage to show up
  on the client for some people. 
  Thanks to Alan Beale <agb@openplus.co.uk> for the fix.


Enjoy,
