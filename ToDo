in no particular order:

cleanup Makefile.PL!!!

get rid of basic_http_header usage (almost there)

make sure we can handle graceful restart

extend $r->notes method so we can store arbitrary Perl structures

think about re-introducing perl_alloc..perl_free option for each
request now that embedding bugs are fixed in Perl 5.004  

Apache::Registry should honor __END__ and __DATA__,
but how to get it right?

improve the "stacked handlers" implementation, including:
-allowing all array-like operations besides push_handlers,
pop_handlers, shift_handlers, unshift_handlers, splice_handlers, etc.

-allow push_handlers to have an additional argument, an array ref,
which will be passed to the handler as arguments, e.g.
 $r->push_handlers("PerlHandler", \&some_sub, ['one', 'two', 'etc']);

-allow Perl*Handler's to have arguments in config files, e.g.:

 PerlHandler FooPackage [One Two Three]
 (calls &FooPackage::handler($r, "One", "Two", "Three");

complete <Perl></Perl> configuration section 
 
provide an optional and configurable Safe wrapper around embedded scripts

explore mechanisms for sharing database connections amoung server children

figure out how to route request to specific child to maintain state

find a good way to make Apache::exit override CORE::exit no matter where we are

find good ways to decrease size of httpd (perl-runtime!)

port to win32 (need apache there first of course!)

more tests for the test suite

add more examples
