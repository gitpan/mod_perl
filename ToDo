in no particular order:

get rid of basic_http_header usage

figure out why the heck filehandles used with file upload show up under
'unknown' in our symbol table dump, and why the heck they are even in the
symbol table (stems from CGI.pm now XA.pm)

Apache::Registry should honor __END__ and __DATA__,

(e.g. PerlTransHandler OneSub TwoSub RedSub BlueSub)

provide an optional and configurable Safe wrapper around embedded scripts

find good ways to decrease size of httpd (perl-runtime!)

more tests for the test suite

add more examples
