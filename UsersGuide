Apache/Perl API
---------------
Type 'perldoc Apache' for info on how to use the Perl-Apache API.
See also: Apache::Registry, Apache::SSI, Apache::CGI, Apache::Debug
See the eg/ directory for example scripts.


mod_perl
--------
To tell Apache you want mod_perl to handle your scripts add to your
srm.conf:

    AddType httpd/perl .pl


mod_perl_fast
-------------
To tell Apache you want mod_perl_fast to handle your scripts add to
your srm.conf:

    AddHandler perl-script .fpl

Now, any file with the extension '.fpl' will be executed by mod_perl_fast.
However, if your PerlHandler is Apache::Registry::handler, this module
will check to see if 'ExecCGI' is allowed in that directory before
executing it.
See the Apache::Registry module for details.
 
You may perl load modules via

    PerlModule Apache::Registry Apache::SSI SomeOther::Module

Optionally:

    PerlScript  /full/path/to/script_to_load_at_startup.pl

This script will be loaded when the server starts. See eg/mpf_eg.pl
for an example to start with.

In an access.conf <Directory /foo> or .htaccess you need:

    PerlHandler sub_routine_name

This is the name of the subroutine to call to handle each request. 
e.g. 
in the PerlScript mpf_eg.pl this is "main::handler".
in the PerlModule Apache::Registry this is "Apache::Registry::handler".

The recommended configuration is as follows:

#srm.conf
Alias /perl/  /real/path/to/perl-scripts/
PerlModule Apache::Registry

#access.conf 
<Location /perl>
SetHandler perl-script
PerlHandler Apache::Registry::handler
Options ExecCGI
</Location>

By default, mod_perl_fast does not send any headers by itself, however, you
may wish to change this:

    PerlSendHeader On	

By default, mod_perl_fast does not setup %ENV, you may wish to change this:

    PerlSetupEnv On

With the recommended configuration, these options and Perl linked with sfio 
(see INSTALL), scripts running under Apache::Registry will look just like 
"normal" CGI scripts.  See eg/perlio.pl as an example.

WARNINGS
--------

For *both* mod_perl and mod_perl_fast:

Your scripts *cannot* be in a ScriptAlias(ed) (which is usually /cgi-bin) directory.

Your scripts *will not* run from the command line (yet).

Support
-------

to majordomo@listproc.itribe.net with the string "subscribe modperl"
in the body.
