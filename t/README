Self test suite for the mod_perl library 
adapted from the libwww-perl test suite
-------------------------------------------

Tests are invoked by running the ./TEST script, but usually you run
the tests with "make test" at the top mod_perl directory.  Use -v
option for verbose tests.  You might run an individual test like this:

  ./TEST -v net/http-get

or all tests in a directory like this

  ./TEST net

You enable network tests by creating the "net/config.pl" file.  A good
start is to make a copy of the "net/config.pl.dist" file.  For network
tests you should also make a link from the perl directory of your
http server to the "net/perl" directory.  

You *must* have libwww-perl installed:
http://www.perl.com/cgi-bin/cpan_mod?module=LWP

You will also need to modify "conf/*" and start an httpd with the mod_perl
configuration specified in httpd.conf-dist

The following setup works for my site:

  ln -s `pwd`/conf ~/www/httpd/conf
  emacs conf/*.conf			     #modify for your system	
  ln -s `pwd`/net/perl ~/www/apache_perl/t
  cp net/config.pl.dist net/config.pl
  emacs net/config.pl                        # fix if necessary
  httpd -d `pwd` 	
  ./TEST net
