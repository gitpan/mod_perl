=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Extra Thanks to:

Andreas Koenig <andreas.koenig@franz.ww.tu-berlin.de>
for *lots* of bug spotting, fixing and patching, 
Apache::Registry and CGI.pm overhaul efforts (aka CGI::XA & CGI::Switch)

Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>
For getting this effort started

Other contributors are mentioned below:

=item 0.83_04

updated INSTALL and UsersGuide documents

misc cleanup here and there

Apache::Options is now just a stub that imports from Apache::Constants

updated Apache.pm and Apache::Constants documentation

added Apache::AuthzAge and Apache::AccessLimitNum modules

added $r->requires and $r->is_main, and $r->main methods

added callback hooks for authorization, access, type-check, 
fixup and logger stages of the request

callback hooks can now be turned off at compile time with 
-DNO_PERL_...., and are turned off by default, except for the
handler stage (PerlHandler) 

reworked installation procedure to follow apache 1.2 recomendations, 
the procedure will still work with older versions of apache.
No more Makefile.tmpl.x.x.x mess!!

updated #if MODULE_MAGIC_NUMBERS >='s so we're inline with apache 1.2-dev-19961009130008

=item 0.83_03

Perl*Handler's are now called with Apache->request as an argument
PerlHandler's may still ask for Apache->request so existing code and
mechanisms such as Apache::Registry will continue to work
However, other handlers such as PerlAuthenHandler and PerlTransHandler,
cannot use Apache->request.

added Apache::Constants module, based on patch to Apache.xs 
from Gisle

updated Apache::Debug with patch from Gisle to 
- update the status codes from the latest
  HTTP::Status and produce a prettier and more output.

- We also ensure that we do not generate output for HEAD requests and we
  set up status correctly.

updated Apache.pm and Apache::Options docs, thanks to Gisle

fixed PerlScript bug spotted by Gisle

renamed Apache::Msql to Apache::MsqlProxy

=item 0.83_02

applied patch from Salvador Garcia <sortiz@cfe.gob.mx> to fix PerlTransHandler bugs
spotted by Hugues Lafarge <Hugues.Lafarge@afp.com>

applied Apache::Registry patch from Andreas  
- allows filanames to start with a digit (you probably saw a "bad
  symbol after ::" error)

- strips path_info before deciding which package the script is compiled
  into.

initial patch

added $r->connection->close method

added $r->exit method

Lincoln Stein <lstein@genome.wi.mit.edu>

subroutines no longer need to return '0' for OK status, 200 and 1

seems like a more appropriate name after Salvador's 
'AddHandler' suggestion
