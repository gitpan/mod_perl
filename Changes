=item 0.95 

******************************************
*** CGI-XA/* removed from distribution ***
CGI.pm-2.32 is now mod_perl compatible, and 
now ships with CGI::Switch and CGI::Apache. 
******************************************

various documentation updates

renamed Apache::CGI to CGI::Apache 
(you should be using CGI::Switch anyhow!!!)

Perl*Handler package names no longer require a '::' to default
to PackageName::handler() when Perl*Handler is just PackageName

renamed eg/MyPackage.pl to startup.pl, pruned way down to
discourage use of PerlScript and avoid the confusion it has caused in
the past 

updated Makefile.tmpl-1.2 to work with 1.2b8-dev, there will be
a "Multiple rules lines" warning, once 1.2b8 is released, we'll 
take this out

added $r->prev and $r->next methods 

added Apache->taint method

Apache->untaint method now in Apache.xs

added $r->seqno method suggested by Lincoln Stein

added GETC and READLINE for tie *STDIN completeness

fixed Apache::CGI+file upload w/ patch from Andreas

data read from client ($r->read*, $r->args), %ENV, $r->cgi_env and
$r->*header*_* is now marked as tainted, t/net/test now tests this
(only with with `PerlTaintCheck On' of course)

various cleanup, including shifting things so Apache.o can be detached
from httpd to Apache.sl if the need arises 

now -Wall clean, except for Perl's dXSUB_SYS->dummy

set $|=1 by default #ifdef USE_SFIO

added Apache->module method

added Apache::Status->menu_item method

fixed warnings in Apache->read spotted by Owen Scott Medd

applied Apache::Registry fixes from Andreas

applied NeXT fixes from Jeff Hallgren and Andreas

applied XA.pm patch from Owen Scott Medd <osm@INTERGUIDE.COM> 
so filehandles can be ref's

=item 0.94 - 03/09/97

removed pp_hot.patch from distibution

t/net/http-post.t will now test the tie'd *STDIN if $] >= 5.003_93

*STDIN is now tie'd to the client, only works if perl version is
>= 5.003_93 

removed Apache::TieHandle from the distribution as it is no longer
needed.  however, scripts that are currently using:
use Apache:TieHandle ();
tie *STDOUT => "Apache::TieHandle";
will not break, but will produce a no longer needed warning

removed Apache::Registry's attempt to honor __END__, as Andreas
pointed out, this can't really be done right unless we have
Perl::Lex and Perl::Parse :-)

applied Makefile.PL patch from Andreas to use modules instead of
system() where possible

Apache::Constants now defines SERVER_SUBVERSION,
as suggested by Andreas

removed is_perlaliased from Apache::Debug, caught by Andreas

=item 0.93_01 - 03/04/97

added 'use ExtUtils::testlib' to t/docs/startup.pl since PERL5LIB
is shutoff with -T!?!

picky compilers should no longer complain of things reported
by Mike Stok and George Hartlieb when sfio is configured in

added (temporary?) `PerlWarn' directive to pass the -w switch
to perl_parse

bug fix so stderr is hooked to the error_log as it was and
should be (unless PERL_TRACE is defined)

argv[0] to perl_parse is now "httpd", making the value of 
magic $^X "httpd"

`PerlSetupEnv' now on by default

Apache::Registry parses command line switches if it sees #!, 
only -w and -T are recognized at the moment (not enough!)

Apache::Registry now honors __END__

added Apache->untaint method

added `PerlTaintCheck' directive to startup with -T switch

during 'make test' t/TEST now installs a die handler to shutdown httpd 
before make aborts if a test fails as suggested by Gary Shea  

we now passthru httpd's CFLAGS1 via MM's DEFINE
(I needed this for -DHPUX10 + Apache::Constants)  

we now define SERVER_SUBVERSION as suggested by Andreas

fixed $$ bug in CGI::XA with fix from Salvador Garcia

added $r->is_initial_req method, now used by these modules:
Apache::AuthenDBI, Apache::AccessLimitNum, Apache::AuthzAge

Apache::warn now overrides CORE::warn in Apache::Registry scripts,
which is an alias for Apache::log_error 

Apache::exit now overrides CORE::exit in Apache::Registry scripts,
now converted CGI scripts can safely call plain 'ol exit;

$r->exit will close the client connection for you, no need for
$r->connection->close, which is no longer documented, and does 
nothing but warn not to call it.

fixed cookie bugs in CGI::XA spotted by Andrew Tennant

#undef some symbols that caused clashes #ifdef HPUX10
and ones on solaris spotted by Bowen Dwelle

=item 0.93 

updated Makefile.tmpl-1.2 to be inline with 1.2b6

removed 1.2b5 Makefile.tmpl, 1.2b1..b5 no longer supported

mortalize return value from $r->read_client_block

make Apache::CGI scrict clean thanks to Frank Cringle

=item 0.92 - 01/23/97

fixed core-dump-causing bug spotted by Mike Stok

=item 0.91 - 01/22/97

perl_init now says 'use Apache::Constants qw(OK DECLINED)' (in C) so you can
say 'Perl*Handler DECLINED', suggested by, you guessed it, Rob

applied patch from Rob so Makefile.PL copies $APACHE_SRC/Configuration to src/
if it has been changed

added Makefile.tmpl-1.2b5 from Rob

applied patch from Rob Hartill to stop $r->cgi_env($key) from core-dumping 
if $key does not exist

applied PerlModule overflow check patch from Rob Hartill

added $r->as_string method

=item 0.90_01

depreciation of Apache->request use outside of Apache::CGI and scripts
that run under Apache::Registry now spits out a warning.  See Apache.pm
doc update for details.

$r->is_perlaliased has gone away

added api tests

added tests for callback hooks besides PerlHandler

added Apache::perl_hook function

if a callback does not return a status values, we assume OK, 
fatal errors would have never made it that far anyhow, 
still log warning to error_log, but carry on

clean up here and there

added PerlHeaderParserHandler callback hook for apache versions >= 1.2b5

added $r->connection->aborted method
added $r->the_request and $r->header_only methods
added Apache::Server methods: is_virtual and names

added $r->headers_out and $r->err_header_out methods:
header*_* methods are now consistent, see Apache.pm docs

should now use $r->err_header_out instead of $r->err_headers_out
to set the value of an err_header

added 1.1.3 to Makefile.PL version map after hint from Arin Goldberg

src/modules/perl/Makefile now detects modules linked static with
your perl and links them with httpd

Apache::CGI->read_from_client now calls $r->read instead of 
$r->read_client_block

applied fix for bug in read_client_block thanks to Milan Votava 

updated Apache::SSI documentation

can now 'make test PORT=xxxx'

can now 'make start_httpd', 'make kill_httpd' for testing

perl Makefile.PL ALL_HOOKS=1 enables all Perl*Handler callbacks

$r->filename will re-stat r->finfo if you change the filename as
suggested by Rob Hartill

Makefile.PL now copies $APACHE_SRC/Configuration to src/ modifies, 
then tells apache's Configure to use this copy with -file

applied patch from Pai-Ling Hsiao <pailing@STRAWBERRY.UCC.UCONN.EDU>
o fix CGI::XA->*_group bugs

t/constants/export.t now tests _all_ of @EXPORT and %EXPORT_TAGS

fixed bugs in Apache::Constants spotted by John Groenveld and Rob Hartill

Apache.xs now uses rwrite() if apache >= 1.2b4

=item 0.90

perl Makefile.PL PERL_TRACE=1 will now enable tracing

changed Makefile.PL so we can enable callback hooks ala:
  perl Makefile.PL PERL_AUTHEN=1 PERL_FIXUP=1

updated INSTALL and mod_perl.pod to reflect this change

=item 0.89

fixed bug spotted by Rob Hartill so perl_cmds[] is not prematurely
terminated

added Bundle::Apache module for use with CPAN.pm

fixed Constants/Makefile.PL so -I picks up $(APACHE_SRC) no matter what,
thanks to Mike Stok

=item 0.88

applied Makefile.PL patch from Rob Hartill so we compile with 1.2b3

=item 0.87

As suggested by Andreas, Makefile.PL now asks:
"Configure mod_perl with ../apache_xxx ?"
  answering 'y' only means there is where we can find *.h
"Shall I build httpd in $adir for you?"
  answering 'y' will run ../apache_xxx/Configure 
  and httpd will be built when running 'make'
 
$r->read now returns $nrd as it should

'perl Makefile.PL NO_HTTPD=1' will build only the perl side of
mod_perl (still need httpd.h for Constants.sl)

'make test' now picks up modules in ./blib as it should, bug
spotted by Mike Stok
 
ServerName is set to localhost in httpd.conf as suggested by 
Mike Stok and Frank Cringle

=item 0.86

Port is a little more random for tests '8529'

applied patch from Edmund Mergl <E.Mergl@BAWUE.DE> bringing CGI::XA 
up-to-date with CGI.pm 2.29

perl_destruct_level is set to 0 in mod_perl.c, while progress is being
made on fixing perl_{con,des}truct in 5.003_12

if there is no httpd.conf, Makefile.PL creates one for you, filling in
User and Group with uid and gid of the current process

updated Makefile.tmpl-1.2 with Makefile.tmpl from apache 1.2b2

if Makefile.PL finds apache version >= 1.2b3, instead of copying
Makefile.tmpl to ../src/apache_x.x, it uses the new '-make Makefile.tmpl'
option, made possible by Rob Hartill
otherwise, same as before and it now tells you it's made a backup 
'Makefile.tmpl.bak'

fixed 'make test', so you _really_ don't have to modify anything,
hopefully

if libwww-perl is not installed, the tests that require it will not be run,
and it will be suggested that you install the library, but who doesn't
have libwww-perl installed???

=item 0.85_06

same as 0.85_05, just fixed broken tarball
 
=item 0.85_05

fixed Makefile.PL bug spotted by Gary Shea <shea@XMISSION.COM>

applied XA.pm fix from Edmund Mergl <E.Mergl@BAWUE.DE>

updated docs and examples here and there

'make test' improved, all uneeded directives and files stripped out,
should be able to run with no modification, nothing by hand other than
'make test'

now make sure that CC we use to build httpd is the same as CC used to
build Perl, thanks to Andreas

added 'make offsite-tar' target for build the perl-side on machines 
without apache source

fixed Makefile.tmpl* so people define EXTRA_FLAGS as suggested by Rob Hartill

a few minor fixes for Apache-SSL users

=item 0.85_04

applied patch from Rob Hartill to fix bug in $r->cgi_env

%ENV is cleared after each callback (&Perl*Handler)

added $r->cgi_var as suggested by Andreas:
calls $r->cgi_env($key) in a scalar context to prevent the 
mistake of calling in a list context.

if a Perl*Handler returns something > 600 we assume OK (for now)

bug fixed introduced in 0.85_03 for Perl*Handler's not prefixed with 
a Package:: causing httpd to sigsegv

ship with Makefile.tmpl-Ben-SSL for Apache-SSL users

Makefile.PL a little smarter
-knows if we're configuring with Ben-SSL, uses Makefile.tmpl-Ben-SSL
-after looking for 1.1.1 and 1.2*, globs for <apache*> not <apache_*>
-instead of rm -rf'ing the modules/perl/ directory we're configuring
 against, we only rm -f those found in our MANIFEST

applied patch from Frank Cringle <fdc@CLIWE.PING.DE> to fix defaults
in CGI::XA

got rid of stupid warning "missing test.pl"

=item 0.85_03

cleaned up internal perl_setup_env()

Perl*Handler's default to calling Perl*Handler::handler if the
Perl*Handler is just a class name, e.g. 'PerlHandler Apache::Registry'
will call Apache::Registry::handler
In addition, the class module will be loaded if it is not already, 
so there is no need to specify PerlModule

added Apache::Status module 

$r->print now sets a hard_timeout() before sending to the client
$r->read now sets a hard_timeout() before reading from the client

added $r->soft_timeout, $r->hard_timeout, $r->kill_timeout and
$r->reset_timeout methods

top-level Makefile.PL looks further for apache_x.x/src/ 
prompts you if nothing found

applied fix from Andreas to s/privlib/privlibexp/ in src/modules/perl/Makefile

applied patch from Rob Hartill <robh@imdb.com> to correctly initialize
cld->sendheader and cld->setup_env

=item 0.85_02

Apache::DBIAuthen renamed Apache::AuthenDBI and split out from
Apache::Authen

Apache::Authen->handler renamed Apache::Authen->check
as it is not a handler, only used by handlers

added ToDo file

updated UserGuide, now called 'mod_perl.pod'

updated INSTALL and README docs

perl_init will only perl_alloc and perl_contstruct once when the server
starts, meaning no more mad leaks when server is restarted

modified test suite adding extra tests for sfio and TIEHANDLE

unless Perl was configured to use perlio and sfio, STDOUT is tied by default to
the client, no more need for tie *STDOUT => Apache::TieHandle

Makefile.PL now looks for ../apache_1.1.1/src/, apache_1.2*/src/ to configure 
against

Fixed Makefile.PL bug spotted by Frank Cringle <fdc@CLIWE.PING.DE>, 
when no apache source was present or chosen to configure against

'make clean' will now cd $(APACHE_SRC) && $(MAKE) clean

applied patch from Rob Hartill <robh@imdb.com> to bring us up-to-date
with apache_1.2b0

$r->content now calls $r->read instead of $r->read_client_block

$r->read is no longer an alias for $r->read_client_block
The new $r->read implementation is based on patches and ideas from 
Milan Votava <ms.anet.cz@MS.ANET.CZ>,
Joonsuk Bae <bae@yahoo.com>,
and Gisle

=item 0.85_01

added 'tar_Apache' target for copying the perl-side of mod_perl to other 
machines without dragging the apache-side along.

'perl Makefile.PL' now Configures Apache to link mod_perl 
if ../apache_1.2-dev or ../apache_1.1.1  src/Configuration is found
In addition, 'apache_httpd' is added to the 'make all' target 

now include Makefile.tmpl-1.2

fix for 1.2's const requirement

=item 0.85

added the start of a mod_perl test suite

got rid of conditional perl*rec members, which was causing compile problems
for some people

$r->exit now logs transactions before exit()'ing the process

applied clean-up and debug enhancement patch to Apache::Registry from Andreas

applied patch from Andreas to reduce Apache->request calls in Apache::CGI

$r->cgi_env now accepts arguments for setting variables

=item 0.84 - October 27, 1996

added pointer to Patrick Kane's <modus@enews.com> FAQ

applied Makefile.PL patches from Gisle

=item 0.83_10

send_cgi_header now sets $r->status to REDIRECT when it finds a Location
header which is not an internal redirect

Apache::Registry now returns $r->status rather than always OK

dropped old approach of the original mod_perl.c, mod_perl_fast functionality
has moved to the all-knowing, all-doing mod_perl

Makefile.PL for Apache::Constants looks for httpd.h in ../../apache*/src/ 
before prompting

dropped OK from @{$Apache::Constants::EXPORT_TAGS{response_codes}}

updated Constants.xs with patch from Gisle

applied Makefile.PL patch from Gisle to set PERL= in Makefile*

=item 0.83_09

fixed bug with get_basic_auth_pw spotted by Patrick Kane <modus@enews.com>

=item 0.83_08

get_basic_auth_pw now returns the $send_pw, rather that setting it,
see Apache.pm docs
 
applied patch from Andreas with the following changes:

1) regex directory added in Constants/Makefile.PL. Current apache
   always needs -Iregex, that means for us an additional
   -I$httpd/regex. I think, they should

    #include <regex/something.h>

2) Assorted comments added to INSTALL, especially

  * FileHandle bug explained as being a 5.003 bug (not "current")

  * Configuration/Configuration.tmpl relation explained

  * && instead of ; to separate commands is a must in Makefiles

  * Gisle's hint about the default seems very important to me, so is
    there again.

3) Drops the deprecated mod_alias patch from the whole distribution

4) A whitespace patch for src/modules/perl/Makefile

5) The regex directory also for src/modules/perl/Makefile

6) Shuffling of code between mod_perl_fast.c and mod_perl.h until it
   fits the bill, who knows why :-0

=item 0.83_07

added the missing src/modules/perl/Makefile (again)

=item 0.83_06

brought back Makefile.tmpl for current public release

added src/modules/perl/ldopts script, rather than using 'make ldopts'

INSTALL doc fix so 1.1.1 users define RANLIB
 
MODULE_MAGIC_NUMBER fix so we still build with 1.1.1
 
no longer pstrdup when fetching r->args

dropped undocumented SKIP_AUTH_HEADER thingy

=item 0.83_05

added missing Makefile to src/modules/perl/

turned off PERL_TRACE, oops

moved SERVER_VERSION from Apache.xs to Constants.xs

applied another doc patch to Apache.pm from Gisle

=item 0.83_04

updated INSTALL and UsersGuide documents

added Apache::AuthzAge and Apache::AccessLimitNum modules

added $r->requires and $r->is_main, and $r->main methods

added callback hooks for authorization, access, type-check, 
fixup and logger stages of the request

callback hooks can now be turned off at compile time with 
-DNO_PERL_...., and are turned off by default, except for the
handler stage (PerlHandler) 

reworked installation procedure to follow apache 1.2 recomendations, 
the procedure will still work with older versions of apache.
No more Makefile.tmpl.x.x.x mess!!

updated #if MODULE_MAGIC_NUMBERS >='s so we're inline with apache 1.2-dev-19961009130008

=item 0.83_03

Perl*Handler's are now called with Apache->request as an argument
PerlHandler's may still ask for Apache->request so existing code and
mechanisms such as Apache::Registry will continue to work
However, other handlers such as PerlAuthenHandler and PerlTransHandler,
cannot use Apache->request.

added Apache::Constants module, based on patch to Apache.xs 
from Gisle

updated Apache::Debug with patch from Gisle to 
- update the status codes from the latest
  HTTP::Status and produce a prettier and more output.

- We also ensure that we do not generate output for HEAD requests and we
  set up status correctly.

updated Apache.pm and Apache::Options docs, thanks to Gisle

added $r->connection->close method

added $r->exit method

applied patch from Rob Hartill <robh@imdb.com> so read_client_block

Lincoln Stein <lstein@genome.wi.mit.edu>

subroutines no longer need to return '0' for OK status, 200 and 1

xs_init now gets linked with us, as generated by Devel::embed
so we can bootstrap static extensions (including Apache)

stomped out *main:: variables, moved to Apache.xs as methods

added method 'request' to return the request pointer object
And did a typedef request_rec * Apache
