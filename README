README for the Apache/Perl modules

This Apache module embeds a perl interpreter in the HTTP server.  
One benefit of this is that we are able to run scripts without 
going through the expensive (fork/exec/parameter passing/parsing, 
perl-startup time, etc.) CGI interface.  
Not only will scripts run faster, they have direct access to the C API 
of the server, allowing the developer to extend Apache server 
functionality with modules written in Perl.

The current approach of mod_perl is to allocate and construct one
perl interpreter when the server starts.  At the same time, load,
parse and run one perl script, which may pull in other perl code such
as your favorite modules.  This also allows you to initiate persistent
connections such as to a database server.  Then, a subroutine in
memory is called to handle each request.  The interpreter is destroyed
upon restart or shutdown of the server.

Type 'perldoc mod_perl' for more information.
