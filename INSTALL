INSTALL - Apache mod_perl installation instructions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

How to build, test, configure and install mod_perl

=head1 PREREQUSITES

=over 3

Apache version 1.1.x or 1.2b9+ 

Perl version 5.003 or higher

If you do not have Perl version 5.003_01 or higher,
fetch and install ExtUtils::Embed from CPAN 
<URL:http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/ExtUtils/ExtUtils-Embed-1.10.tar.gz>

=back

=head1 Build and install mod_perl

=over 3

In this current directory run:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test (optional)	
  make install

Makefile.PL will search for apache source trees to configure against, 
if no source trees are found, you will be prompted for a path to one.

When asked:

   "Configure mod_perl with ../apache_xxx ?"

answering 'y' only means there is where we can find src/*.h

When asked:

   "Shall I build httpd in $adir for you?"

answering 'y' will run ../apache_xxx/Configure 
and httpd will be built when running 'make'

You can avoid this prompt by starting with the following command:

  perl Makefile.PL NO_HTTPD=1

You may wish see the instructions below on how to build by hand.

In any case, you need to 'make install' so the perl side of mod_perl
will be installed.

By default, all callback hooks except for PerlHandler are turned off.
You may edit src/modules/perl/Makefile, or enable when running Makfile.PL
Possible arguments are:

  PERL_INIT
  PERL_TRANS
  PERL_HEADER_PARSER
  PERL_AUTHEN
  PERL_AUTHZ
  PERL_ACCESS
  PERL_TYPE
  PERL_FIXUP
  PERL_LOG
  PERL_CLEANUP
  
  PERL_STACKED_HANDLERS
  PERL_METHOD_HANDLERS
  PERL_SECTIONS
  PERL_SSI

Example to enable PerlAuthenHandler and PerlFixupHandler:
 
  perl Makefile.PL PERL_AUTHEN=1 PERL_FIXUP=1

To enable all callback hooks:

   perl Makefile.PL ALL_HOOKS=1 

To enable tracing set PERL_TRACE=1

  perl Makefile.PL PERL_TRACE=1

=item Linking Perl extensions static with httpd

Normally, if an exension is linked static with Perl it is listed in
Config.pm's $Config{static_exts}, in which case, mod_perl will also
link this extension static with httpd.  However, if an extension is
linked static with Perl after it is installed, it is not listed in
Config.pm.  You may either edit Config.pm and add these extensions, or
configure mod_perl like so:

 perl Makefile.PL "PERL_STATIC_EXTS=Something::Static Another::One"

=head1 Testing mod_perl

=over 3

Running 'make test' will start an httpd on port 8529 running under
the uid and gid of the 'perl Makefile.PL' process, the httpd will 
be terminated when the tests are finshed.

To change the default port say:

 perl Makefile.PL PORT=xxxx

To simply start the newly build httpd before 'make install' run:

 make start_httpd

To shutdown this httpd run:

 make kill_httpd

See t/README on how to run the mod_perl test suite by hand

NOTE to Ben-SSL users:
httpsd does not seem to handle '/dev/null' as the location of certain
files, you'll have to change these by hand. 
Tests are run with 'SSLDisable'

=head1 Building apache and mod_perl by hand

=over 3

** Only if you did not let Makefile.PL take care of this already **
 
=item mod_perl source files

Copy the source files into the apache build directory:
(For apache versions < 1.2 you'll need to mkdir src/modules/ first)

	cp -r src/modules/perl  apache_xxx/src/modules/

=item Makefile.tmpl

apache_1.1.x users: copy src/Makefile.tmpl to apache_xxx/src/  

apache 1.2 (b8+) users: no need to modify the Makefile.tmpl

=item Configuration

Edit apache_xxx/src/Configuration, and add: 

	Module perl_module	   modules/perl/libmodperl.a

We suggest you add this entry at the end of the Configuration file if
you want your callback hooks to have precedence over core handlers. 

Add the following to EXTRA_LIBS:

	EXTRA_LIBS=`perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e ldopts`

Follow the apache install docs from there

=head1 Configuring and building with Stronghold

=over3

You must first build and install Stronghold without mod_perl,
following Stronghold's install procedure.

Then, you may rebuild following the instructions above to:

 Build and install mod_perl

  or

 Building apache and mod_perl by hand

I you are configuring by hand, be sure to edit
src/modules/perl/Makefile and uncomment #APACHE_SSL

For Solaris 2.5 users, there has been a report related to the REGEX
that comes with Stronghold, after building Apache with mod_perl would
produce core dumps. 
To get around this:

In STRONGHOLD/src/Configuration, Change:

  Rule WANTHSREGEX=default

To:

  Rule WANTHSREGEX=no

=back

=head1 Installing on multiple machines

=over 3

You may wish to build httpd once, then copy it to other machines.
The Perl side of mod_perl needs the apache headers files to compile,
to avoid dragging and build apache on all your other machines, there
are a few Makefile targets to help you out:

   'make tar_Apache'

This will tar all files mod_perl installs in your 'site_perl' directory,
into a file called 'Apache.tar'.
You can then unpack this under 'site_perl' on another machine.

   'make offsite-tar'

This will copy all header files from the apache source directory you 
configured mod_perl against, then it will 'make dist' where you'll
a mod_perl-x.xx.tar.gz created, ready to unpack on another machine
to compile and install the Perl side of mod_perl.

=head1 Notes

=over 3

=item BSDI users

Gary Shea <shea@xmission.com> discovered a nasty BSDI bug (seen in
versions 2.1 and 3.0) related to dynamic loading and two workarounds: 

Turns out they use argv[0] to determine where to find the link
tables at run-time, so if a program either changes argv[0],
or does a chdir() (like apache!), it can easily confuse the
dynamic loader.  The short-term solutions to the problem are
pitifully simple.  Either of the following will work:

1) Call httpd with a full path, e.g. /opt/www/bin/httpd

2) Put the httpd you wish to run in a directory in your PATH
before any other directory containing a version of httpd, then
call it as 'httpd' -- don't use a relative path!

=item Perl 5.003 users

This install includes the module Apache::Registry, which uses the
standard module 'FileHandle'.  There was a bug in the version of this
module, that came with perl5.003, so if your perl is not younger than
5.003 we suggest you apply the patch 'FileHandle.patch' to fix the
problem until it is fixed in the standard distribution of Perl.
Although, it is a strange bug, you might not even see it without the
patch...

=item Perl Static Extensions

If you wish to use a module that is normally linked static with your
Perl, it must be listed in static_ext in Perl's Config.pm to be linked
with httpd during the mod_perl build.

To list your static extensions, run this command:

 perl -V:static_ext

If your module is not listed, add it to this line in Config.pm:

 static_ext=' '

=item more info

Type 'perldoc mod_perl' for info on configuring, running
and writing Apache/Perl scripts and modules.

=head1 Using PerlIO

=over 3

See 'perldoc mod_perl' for an explaination
See the Perl INSTALL document for more information.

Here's how to configure your perl with sfio:

 % Configure -des -Duseperlio -Dusesfio 

With Perl version 5.003_93 or higher, there is no need to configure
with sfio for using Perl's read() and print() functions, STDIN and
STDOUT are tie'd to the client connection.
