INSTALLATION for mod_perl.c, mod_perl_fast.c and Apache.*

**IMPORTANT**
Currently, you can only use mod_perl *or* mod_perl_fast.
Unless you have figured out a way to build perl with -DEMBED *and* -DMULTIPLICITY.  (There is will be fixed in the next release of Perl)
You may however, build Apache with both modules.
To "turn off" mod_perl, simply #comment out the AddType httpd/perl .pl
To "turn off" mod_perl_fast, simply #comment out the PerlScript scriptname.pl in srm.conf
*************

Build with apache1.1b2 or better.

Make sure you have perl version 5.002_01 or better, compiled with -DEMBED
(this is the default with 5.002_01) otherwise, Apache and Perl fight over namespace.
Look under CPAN/src/5.0/unsupported/

Fetch and install ExtUtils::embed from CPAN 
<URL:http://www.perl.com/cgi-bin/cpan_mod?module=ExtUtils::embed>.

You'll need to use the Makefile.tmpl file in this directory for 1.1b4, 
(Makefile.tmpl.1.1b2 for 1.1b2), or make changes to your copy.

You'll also need to edit the Configuration file:

For mod_perl add:
Module perl_module mod_perl.o

For mod_perl_fast add:
Module perl_fast_module mod_perl_fast.o

Copy the files in this src/ to apache's src/

Follow the Apache install docs from there.

*******************************************************
To tell Apache you want mod_perl to handle your scripts:
AddType httpd/perl .pl

And that's it.
*******************************************************

*******************************************************
To tell Apache you want mod_perl_fast to handle your scripts:
AddType httpd/fast-perl .fpl

In srm.conf:
PerlScript  script_to_load_at_startup.pl

This script will be loaded when the server starts.

In an access.conf <Directory /foo> or .htaccess:
PerlResponse sub_routine_name

This is the name of the subroutine to call (defined in PerlScript)
to handle each request.
*******************************************************

*******************************************************
For *both* mod_perl and mod_perl_fast:
Your scripts *cannot* be in a ScriptAlias(ed) directory.
Your scripts *will not* run from the command line (yet).
*******************************************************

The perl modules under lib/ can be installed by saying:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make install

See Apache.pm on how to use the Perl-Apache API
See the eg/ directory for example scripts.

IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS

Please send mail to modperl@listproc.itribe.net with the output of:

Along with:

which module you are trying to use (mod_perl or mod_perl_fast),
and version of the package.

which script from the eg/ directory you are using.
(please try a script from there first.)

your apache server version details of your server configuration.

if you get a core dump, please send a backtrace if possible.
