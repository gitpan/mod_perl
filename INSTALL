INSTALLATION for mod_perl.c, mod_perl_fast.c and Apache.*

**IMPORTANT**
-------------

Currently, you can only use mod_perl *or* mod_perl_fast.
You may however, build Apache with both modules.
To "turn off" mod_perl, simply #comment out the AddType httpd/perl .pl in srm.conf.

Prerequisites
-------------

You need apache1.1b2 or better.

Make sure you have perl version 5.002_01 or better, compiled with -DEMBED
(this is the default with 5.002_01+ anyway)

Fetch and install ExtUtils::Embed from CPAN 
<URL:http://www.perl.com/cgi-bin/cpan_mod?module=ExtUtils::Embed>.

Build and install the perl part of this module
----------------------------------------------

The perl modules under lib/ can be installed by saying (in this current directory):

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make install

*** NOTE ***
This install includes the module Apache::Registry, which uses the standard
module 'FileHandle'.  There is a bug in the current version of this module,
we suggest you apply the patch 'FileHandle.patch' to fix the problem
until it is fixed in the standard distribution of Perl.
Although, it is a strange bug, you might not even see it without the patch...
 
Build apache
------------

To build the apache server, you'll need to use the Makefile.tmpl file
in this directory for 1.1b4+, (Makefile.tmpl.1.1b2 for 1.1b2), or make
changes to your copy. So either copy the Makefile.tmpl in this
directory to the apache_xxx/src/ directory or edit
apache_xxx/src/Makefile.tmpl first.

You'll also need to edit the apache_xxx/src/Configuration file in the
apache build directory:

For mod_perl add:

    Module perl_module mod_perl.o

For mod_perl_fast add:

    Module perl_fast_module mod_perl_fast.o

Copy the files in this src/ to apache's src/

Follow the Apache install docs from there.

See the 'UsersGuide' file for info on configuring, running
and writing Apache/Perl scripts and modules.
